# spring-boot-course-API

Spring Boot Application for a university to maintain various topics and courses offered by the university.
- Simple MVC Architecture.
- All CRUD operations (PUT, POST, GET, DELETE) exposed through RESTful endpoints.
- Spring Security, OAuth and Login verification.

Postman remains my frontend as of now. Will be updating this and will add some features.
